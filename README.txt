About
-----

This module extends Dataface to allow its applications to use Yale's
CAS (Central Authentication Service).  For more information about CAS
see http://www.ja-sig.org/products/cas/ </p>

This module includes the ESUP PHP CAS module as part of the distribution,
   (http://esup-phpcas.sourceforge.net/) which carries with it an LGPL.</p>


Installation
-------------

1. Download the CAS module and extract the contents of the tarball into
    your dataface/modules directory.  You should have a directory path
	somewhat like the following:

    	%DATAFACE_PATH%/modules/Auth/cas/...

2. Add the following section to your application's conf.ini file.
   [_auth]
   auth_type = cas
   url = "https://%url.to.cas.com%/%path.to.cas%"
   users_table = "%name_of_your_users_table%"
   username_column = "%username_col%"
   password_column = ""

 	If you are already using authentication in your application, then you will
   have only added 2 new lines:

   		auth_type : Set this to 'cas' to indicate that you want to use the 'cas' module.
    	url : The URL to your CAS service.  Do not include the trailing 'login' in the
    			url.. just the url to the service.

  Please see the Getting Started with Dataface tutorial's section on permissions
     for more information about the '_auth' section of the conf.ini  file.
